# About Us 


## Story

One of America’s  greatest superpowers is our rich history of academic research and collaboration. University research is the engine of innovation in the world and we aim to get more research out of the lab and into the world. 

University research brought us the internet itself when a professor at UCLA sent the first transmission from one computer to another computer in Stanford in 1969. ARPANet further connected Universities working for DARPA and the internet was born.

AlumniDAO aims to carry on this tradition of research, development, and commercialization of bleeding edge technologies.
