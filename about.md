# About Us 


## Story

One of Americaâ€™s  greatest superpowers is our rich history of academic research and collaboration. University research is the engine of innovation in the world and we aim to get more research out of the lab and into the world. 

University research brought us the internet itself when a professor at UCLA sent the first transmission from one computer to another computer in Stanford in 1969. ARPANet further connected Universities working for DARPA and the internet was born.

Quadron aims to carry on this tradition of research, development, and commercialization of bleeding edge technologies.  

## Principles

Quadron's principles, underpinning our mission to offer comprehensive commercialization solutions from idea to asset, emphasize a holistic, platform-centric approach to fostering innovation ecosystems:

- Engagement and Collaboration: We facilitate vibrant connections between academia and the broader innovation economy, promoting collaborative progress.
- Platform Flexibility: Quadron serves as a dynamic interface for idea exchange and innovation, moving beyond traditional frameworks to spark interactive and creative thought.
- Deepening Relationships through Information Awareness: We enhance collaborations by embedding rich, contextual knowledge into existing workflows, enabling more productive and informed partnerships.
- Open Communication: Our commitment to transparency ensures open dialogues within the university community, encouraging feedback and engagement.
- Ethical and Legal Integrity: Quadron adheres to the highest standards of ethics and compliance, safeguarding our community.
- Promoting Innovation through Open Source: Where possible, we share our methodologies and resources, driving forward the development of generative intelligence tools.

Together, these principles drive our endeavor to support the full lifecycle of university innovations, ensuring a path that is not only collaborative and transparent but also deeply rooted in ethical practices.
